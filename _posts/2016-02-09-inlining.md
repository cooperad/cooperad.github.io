[Plz to help, how do I inline images into this blog?](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16248469/12932017/ec18dc14-cf80-11e5-9e54-9d2f154269a1.jpg)

### The following are a means to upload using a browser, instead of pushing from a local repo. 
+ Go to the Issues tab next to Code. (note that this feature can be toggled in the settings)
+ Create new issue/comment on an existing issue.
+ Drag and drop required file into the text box. Wait for the upload to complete.
+ When uploaded, a url is generated -- note this down *BEFORE* you submit the issue/comment. The issue page seems to keep no trace of this url later.
+ Syntax for inserting a picture: \[caption\]\(url\)
