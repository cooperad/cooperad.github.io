(This post will outline the haze of thoughts and visions as we pursue Classifying Topoi. All facts stated are true modulo small lies . Allegories to be taken with a liberal pinch of bath salts. It will be wordy to boot, TeXing reserved for better days and better keyboards.)

1. We want to "classify" certain kinds of "structures" over a space/category/topos. Classifying means the following: there exists a special object, and "classes" of maps from an arbitrary space X into this special object correspond to "structures" over X. We call the special space the Classifying Space of the kind of structures we are interested in.
    + Probing the Classifying Space with a map from a Test Space corresponds to/yields a structure over the Test Space.
